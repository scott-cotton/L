# Contributing to L

You can contribute to L by filing bug reports, feature requests, engaging 
in the discussions, proposing alternate designs, and giving L a whirl, or
benchmarking it.

Your contributions are welcome.

## Goal

The goal of L is 
1. To make it so that Go package authors can at once interoperate
and have different logging styles, conventions, and practices.
1. To make logging observable and interactive in a world where 
remote debugging is the norm.

Please respect these goals when engaging in this project.  

## Code Contributions

L can only accept code contributions if you are willing to file a waiver
of copyright.  To do so, simply state "I grant copyright to L for PR #NNN"
in the associated issue.  If you'd like to become a named author, we can
set up an AUTHORS file.

## Design Contributions

We keep track of design goals and issues, their status, and the history of decisions 
around them.  These can be found in [this file](design-issues.md).  One way to 
engage in the design process is via proposing changes to that file: add decisions,
or add to the status if there is a pattern of usage which can be improved, or add 
an issue and proposed decisions.
